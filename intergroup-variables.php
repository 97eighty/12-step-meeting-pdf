The Twelve Step program of S.L.A.A. has helped many people break
free from the grip of sex and love addiction. Perhaps today
could be the start of your own recovery journey.<br>
<br>
You have already taken a big step in seeking information about
S.L.A.A.&nbsp; The next thing to do is to find out if there is a
meeting near you. One of the greatest gifts to your sobriety is
to meet with other sex and love addicts at a S.L.A.A. meeting. <br>
<br>
By giving and receiving support from others, we not only have a
better chance of staying sober, we also begin to learn how to
engage with people&nbsp; in a non-addictive way.<br>
<br>
There are many resources available in S.L.A.A. to help you
decide if the program is right for you and to help you begin and
maintain your recovery<br>
